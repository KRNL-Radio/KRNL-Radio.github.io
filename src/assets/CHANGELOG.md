### Obligatory Rambling

Merry Christmas! Or, if you don't celebrate Christmas, happy almost-end-of-Christmas-season! (Mariah Carey shall soon be vanquished for at least 8 months, hang in there!) I wanna take a second to thank everyone, particulary Sophie, Grayson, Adrien, Matt, and Brock. Without y'all, we'd be stuck with either the old website, or no website at all. Thank you so much for your support!

Now, for what's new in this release:
* Everything.
* The entire website is new.

### Notable Features
* Instead of having a "new features", I'm going to list some features that I personally think are cool!
    * Because everything is new. I don't want to list everything, so... yeah.
* The members page! Everything about the members page is new, and it's cool!
* There may or may not be some secrets hidden in everyone's pages. Go find them!
* There's a new player page, with fancy particles in the background! Expect more particle sets to be added over time!
* Did I mention that the new player page now interfaces with iOS, Android, and the like? It does!
    * Note: The album art sometimes refuses to load. I'm looking into it!
* Speaking of mobile, I've made some tweaks to the mobile experience. Listening to music on mobile now uses *half* of the data it used to!
    * For the curious, desktop uses 128kbps MP3 encoded audio, and mobile uses 64kbps OGG encoded audio. I'm working on seeing if we can bring desktop a bit higher (to 192kbps), but I'm not sure if that's possible with our current setup.
* There's been some changes to our automatic player (which we haven't named!), and will now attempt to shuffle songs.
    * We're also in the process of adding a lot more (better) songs to the rotation! Expect to ~~see~~ hear some new songs soon! (Read: as soon as my internet stops screaming in pain)

### Known Issues
* The particles are a bit laggy on Safari. They're temporarily disabled on Safari until I can figure out a fix.
    * Note that there is an override, but it's purely intended for development purposes. (Honestly, with all of the debugging info it causes the lag to be even worse. 0/10 not recommended.)
* The E-Board badges have a rendering issue on Chrome, and have a unrelated (but still quite annoying) issue on Firefox. They're temporarily disabled everywhere.
* The player page may be slow to update in some cases. This is intentional for now, and will be fixed in a future release.
* On iOS, the album art will not load outside of the website.
    * This is, suprisingly, not our fault! It's a bug in iOS, and I have *no* idea when it'll be fixed.
* A member's photo can be too large in some cases. This is a known issue, and will be fixed in a future release. For now, enjoy the very large photos!

That's all for now! Until next time, take care!
