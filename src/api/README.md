# "API"

so i hesitate to call this an api, since you have to do some fuckery to get this to load properly, but it's something!

this exports a single (blank) page, which contains a bunch of functions and what not that can be used to interact with the site's internals.

for instance, the `window.api.data.hosts` is a list of all the hosts!

THIS IS THE ONLY PAGE WHERE THE `window.api` IS GUARENTEED. (unless i feel like adding stuff elsewhere. meh.)
